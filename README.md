## Milestone 1
 * Note: Using data from SLMPD led to issues with the coordinate system, as they use state plane NAD83 but do not specify which region that they use. There are hundreds of regions around the world for state plane coordinate mapping, so we tried to do a best fit by testing plane mappings on a coordinate point until we got the closest plane. The coordinates are shifted correctly but are not completely accurate, but so far the data looks good and is positioned well.
